				"Step 1: Choose your Credit Card \n \n Each bank offers dozens of Credit Card options. The card you choose will depend on your expected usage and requirements, and the benefits you want– for example, some Credit Cards are great for travellers, some are designed for entertainment, others may be great for business. \n To know which card is right for you, visit the HDFC Bank Credit Card section. \n Once you have selected the right card for yourself, check with the bank about your eligibility for the card and the documents you must submit with your Credit Card application. \n \n Step 2: Apply for your card \n \n Get all your documents ready – a bank will usually ask for identity, address and income proofs. If you are an existing customer that may not be necessary. \n Apply online or at an ATM or visit your nearest branch with the required documents. \n Most cards come with an annual fee that is typically waived off when you achieve a certain limit of spends in a year. The annual fee will be included in your monthly statement. \n \n Step 3: Activate your card \n \n After your Credit Card application is approved, it is dispatched to your communication address. \n You will need to sign for it at the time of delivery and show some identity proof. \n A PIN (personal identity number) is usually couriered to you separately, whereas the Green PIN is sent on your registered mobile number. You will need the PIN to authenticate any transaction you do on your Credit Card. \n Once you get your Credit Card and the PIN in your hands, head to the nearest ATM of your bank to change the PIN. \n Congratulations! You now have a new Credit Card, and you’re ready for your first purchase. Happy shopping! "
